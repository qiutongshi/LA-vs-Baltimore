# LA-vs-Baltimore
**Background**  
Having a college degree seems to be something beneficial. This project explores the possible correlation between having a college degree and changing the circumstance of individuals with low income parents by looking at the similarities and differences between Baltimore City and Los Angeles. In order to adjust to the inherently different level of income in different areas, this project is also considering the poverty rate of each city. The cities being used are Baltimore and Los Angeles.   

**Business Question**  
Does having a college degree mobilize positive change in the circumstance of individuals with low income parents?  

**Data Source**  
The Oppurtunity Atlas   
https://www.opportunityatlas.org:  
i. The Opportunity Atlas Based at Harvard University, this team of researchers and policy analysts work together to analyze new data and create a platform for local stakeholders to make more informed decisions.  

**Data Analysis**   
We’ll use Microsoft Excel to answer:  
- What is the poverty rate of Baltimore City? Calculating the poverty rate of Baltimore City based on median and average of each location.  
- How do college graduation rates affect individual income? Exploring the relationship between individual income of children from low income families in Los Angeles and Baltimore (correlation coefficient). 
- How do college graduation rates affect poverty rate? Exploring the correlation between college graduation rate and poverty rate in both cities.  
- Which city is performing better, Baltimore City or Los Angeles? Using poverty rate and income distribution to find the answer.  

**Data Answer**  
- Average individual income, low outliers, high outliers, fraction of each outlier, poverty rate, college degree rate.

- Los Angeles has a higher median and average income than Baltimore City. Understandable because Los Angeles has a higher state minimum salary and GDP in general. Both cities have a median income higher than average income because of outliers.

- Los Angeles has larger economic inequality in individual income. Note that Baltimore City has areas where individual income is among the medium range.

- There are still individuals in Los Angeles that are not mobilized well enough that their individual income is too low for the lowest despite their chances of having a college degree is twice as those from the same socioeconomic class in Baltimore City. In Baltimore City, however, individuals have a higher rate of having higher individual income, and none of Baltimorians individual income is too low.

**Recap**
The initial question was assuming that there is a correlation between college graduation rate and individual income/ poverty rate for those whose parents have low income. Unfortunately, this data analysis failed to prove this seemingly “common-sense” assumption. Some additional data that might be helpful include comparing middle and lower income families in Baltimore and looking at the industries people work in. This is important because 1. college degrees’ effect can be undermined because of one’s original socio-economic class. 2. College degree is not the only way to mobilize. Blue-collar and people in business do not necessarily require college degrees.   

**Manipulation in Excel**
1. Use MEDIAN, AVERAGE, COUNTIF, algorithms to find median, average, low ourliers, high outliers, fraction of outliers for individual income of people in Baltimore City and Los Angeles.  
2. Build Pivot Table of median and average income of the two cities and create histogram to compare them.  
3. Build Pivot Table of individual income of each city and put them together to see outliers, genearl distribution.  
4. Build Pivot Table of fraction of low, high, general outliers of Baltimore City and Los Angeles and create a historam comparing these two.
